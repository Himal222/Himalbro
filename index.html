                <p align="justify" >Rapid growth and domestic migration to capital city, Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC), Nepal have amplified land-use transition to unmanaged and unplanned urbanization have exacerbated problems of Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect. Increasing built up surfaces, means of transport and industrial activities are major results for increasing temperature in the city area as compared to other areas. This study focuses on forecasting Land Surface Temperature (LST) using both univariate and multivariate time series models. The primary goal is to predict the impact of climatic factors on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, utilizing data from 1981 to 2019. We analyzed key factors including - (i) relative humidity, (ii) surface pressure, (iii) specific humidity, and (iv) wind speed sourced from the MEERA-2 dataset. A univariate model using exponential smoothing achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.17°C and an R² score of 0.94, highlighting strong predictive accuracy. Additionally, the multivariate Prophet model, which incorporates trend and seasonal components, further refined the forecasting by integrating multiple climatic factors. This study aims provides valuable information via prediction for sustainable urban planning and landscape design in KMC and other 61 districts.</p>

                    Himalaya <i>(ongoing)</i></h3>
                <p align="justify">Soil erosion is a critical environmental challenge in mountainous regions such as Nepal, where 
                    fragile landscapes and intensive land use exacerbate land degradation. This study assesses soil 
                    loss in the Bakraha Watershed by applying the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and the 
                    Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) within a GIS and remote sensing framework. 
                    Twenty stations’ daily rainfall records spanning 24 years were analyzed to develop the rainfall 
                    erosivity (R) factor, while soil erodibility (K) was derived from NARC organic content maps 
                    and laboratory analyses. Topographic factors (L and S) were generated from DEM derivatives 
                    in ArcGIS, and land cover management factors (C and P) were quantified using LULC 
                    classification and NDVI from Google Earth Engine. The results revealed soil erosion rates 
                    ranging from 0 to 515 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (mean: 10.51 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) under USLE and 0 to 5852.88 t ha⁻¹ 
                    yr⁻¹ (mean: 16.65 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) under RUSLE. High erosion susceptibility was concentrated in 
                    barren lands, steep slopes (>26.8%), and agricultural areas, while forests and grasslands 
                    experienced comparatively lower rates. </p>

                <p align="justify">The landslide inventory data were randomly divided, with 80% used for training the models and 
                    20% reserved for validation. The resulting susceptibility maps were categorized into five hazard 
                    levels using the natural breaks method. Both models performed robustly, as confirmed by ROC 
                    curve analysis, though the Weight of Evidence (WoE) model demonstrated superior predictive 
                    accuracy (AUC = 0.866) compared to the Frequency Ratio (FR) model (AUC = 0.854), and 
                    provided a sharper spatial definition of high-risk areas. The WoE model also classified a larger 
                    portion of the watershed (24.64%) as High/Very High susceptibility compared to the FR model 
                    (14.40%). The analysis identified geology, NDVI, slope angle, and soil type as the most significant 
                    causative factors, with high-risk hotspots consistently located along steep valley slopes, river 
                    corridors, and near roads.</p>

            <p align="justify">Earthquake magnitude prediction for Nepal has been carried out in this research using the temporal 
                sequence of historic seismic activities in combination with the machine learning classifiers. 
                Prediction has been made on the basis of mathematically calculated seismic indicators using the 
                earthquake catalog of the region. This work evaluates artificial neural networks’ accuracy when 
                used to predict earthquakes magnitude in Nepal. Several seismicity indicators have been retrieved 
                from the literature and used as input for the networks. Some of them have been improved and 
                parameterized in order to extract more valuable knowledge from datasets. These parameters are 
                based on the well-known geophysical facts of Gutenberg–Richter’s inverse law, distribution of 
                characteristic earthquake magnitudes and seismic quiescence. Machine learning methods, such as 
                random forest, artificial neural network and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, 
                excel at identifying patterns in large-scale databases and offer a potential means to improve 
                earthquake prediction performance.</p>
